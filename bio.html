    <p> I've been studying coding in my free time for around 2 years on and off, I started a free coding course on 'genral assembly',
        then moved on to payed courses such as udemy and codeacademy. I am now currently on a course with 'Generation UK'
        where I have been studying the fundementals for 'html/css/javascript, gitHub and some API's'. This course has really
        pushed me into coming out of my comfort zone, and I'm starting to gain confidence in approaching projects with a more 
        clearer approach than before. I thrilled to have the opportunity to be part of an ever growing industry and will look to
        add my mark of value.
        <br><br>
        Kind Regards
    </p>
